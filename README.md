## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Astro](https://astro.build) - Static Site Generator
- [React](https://reactjs.org) - React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - Types
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - CSS methodology
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - For styles
- [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) - For JS/React sliders

### What I learned

How to work with Astro. I really liked its ".astro" for pages, layouts and components.

It was a way to remember React and keep studying it, Typescript as well.

Sass + BEM still are a great combination.

### Continued development

I want to make just one Slider and create props for each variant.
